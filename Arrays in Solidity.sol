                // added parentheses and the number we want to add/push which is 5 right now. 
    o.push (6); //[11,22,33,44,5,6] that 5 will be called D5 which means default because we added a new number by declaring state variable value o and .push
                // o.push then parenthese () and added a input which is 6 we didn't made any changes to 5 so thats will be called default number it could be a any number. 
    
    // If you want to delete the element from an array then you use the keyword delete followed by the place in the array that you want to delete let's say we want to delete
    // the element at index 1 then we will type/call sate variable which is o and use declare the array [] and the position of the number for example 1;
    delete o[1]; // this will clear the element stored that nums at index one and it will set it to the default value the default of uint is 0
    // so now the array will look something this [11,0,33,44,5,6]
    // The length of the array still remains the same this is something that you will need to keep in mind when you're coding in soldity.

    // If you want to shrink the size of the array then there is one method that is available and it is called pop.
    // pop will remove the last element from the array so if i type o whih i habe to declared its a state variable which is o.pop then it will remove the last element 
    // being 6 so now the array will look like this [11,22,33,44,5] The last element which was 6 is now removed after using this pop commend.
    o.pop() ; // why only parenthese () why no input because to push a specify number we use parenthese () and inside we add a number but in this case we will also use 
    // parenthese () for shrink the size of an array but we will not give any inputs or arguments specify because pop use to remove the last element it could be a number or address it could be any data type part.


    // To get the current length of the array you can call .length but make sure you delcared the variable it could be sate or local.

// Some times you will need to create an arry in memory so i'll show you an example how to create array in memory for this example we will create an array of uint agian and we declared the type by uint then array [] then memory because we want to create array in memory then variable name which is x then intialize the array.
 //   uint[] memory x = uint[](5);
 // parenthese we used in arrays for memory inside parenthese we specify the size of the array i'll say that the size of a array is 5
    // and then semicolon ; This is how you can create an array in memory notice that the array in memory have to be a fixed size. 
    // You won't able to call functions like push and pop.
    // So that the only thing you will able to do with array is just update or get the value for an example we can updat the element in memory by declaring variable o then array [] then inside the array we have to input a postion for an example 0 then will equal to 111; previous element at 0 positon it was 11 but now we updated into 111;

// Now returning the array from a function is not recommended the reason is similar to why you would want to keep your for loop small the bigger the array the more gas
